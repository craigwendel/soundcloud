# SoundCloud

This was our first major project using API's at the Iron Yard and a really fun weekly project!  We connected with the SoundCloud API and you are able to pull artists and tracks off of that API and play the selected song.  A lot of artists' tracks are not available due to the SoundCloud Pro membership needed to view those artists but there are a handful of popular artists' tracks like Chance the Rapper to listen to.
